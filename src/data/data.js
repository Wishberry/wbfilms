      text: "Sprightly Chuskit’s dream of going to school is cut short when she is rendered a paraplegic after an accident. She’s confined to life indoors in the company of her strict grandfather, Dorje. Chuskit continues to harbor hopes of school but Dorje tries to make her understand that school can’t handle her needs. As life at home gets harder, her battle with her grandfather exacerbates. Caught in between their struggle are Chuskit’s parents and her enterprising brother who want to respect the old world views that Dorje represents, but also want to keep Chuskit’s spirit alive. Chuskit will have to get her grandfather to yield or she will have to accept the reality he has chosen for her."

      text: "In Vidarbha, the eastern region of Maharashtra, the period between Diwali and Holi is when farmers retire from the fields and seek entertainment and recreation. The tradition of zhaadi-patti theatre, referred to as Zollywood, takes over — a Rs 400 crore industry that seemingly springs up overnight, with daily performances till the arrival of spring. We get a look into this world through the eyes of a group of enterprising people in the sleepy hamlet of Vadsa over three years in the early '00s. Raja and Deepak are two such dreamers who run a 'press' (production company) together; however, because of Raja's dalliances with one of his actresses at the expense of their work, Deepak and veteran zhaadi-patti actor Narayan Rao part ways and form their own press. As time passes, fortunes swing and lives change, both for better and for worse, but the show never stops."

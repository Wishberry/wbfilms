          <p>The information which we collect and store during normal use of the site is used to monitor the use of the site and to help us further develop the site. Such use does not always result in any personally identifiable data being collected or stored.</p>
          <br/>

Any application, request or enquiry you make, may be passed or made available to group affiliates, some of which may be based in countries that do not have data protection laws. All group affiliates are required to comply with an internal privacy policy which requires that steps are taken to protect your personal data and for it only to be used for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>By submitting your personal data through this website, you shall be consenting to it being processed in the manner described above by group affiliates.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>We assure you that we use your personal data for operational purposes only.

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. We attempt to limit access to personal data about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>

These companies have agreed to securely store and maintain the personal data received from us.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Finally, we may take your personal data and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. Given the non-personal nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this privacy policy on our right to depersonalize your personal data. We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties without your consent.</p>
